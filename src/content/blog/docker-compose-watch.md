  An introduction to `docker compose watch` and a tutorial on how to spin up a full-stack environment with this single command.
---
My favorite use case for *Docker* is to spin up a local database for development purposes.
Taking this a step further, it is possible to run all neccessary components of your application with a single *Docker Compose* configuration.
Until recently, this has been a painful method of doing development since any code changes would require a full restart to take effect. 

Instroduced in a recent update, `docker compose watch` allows *Docker Compose* services to monitor certain code paths and update as you edit and save code.
In this article I will show you how to set up a project using *Next.js* and *PostgreSQL* that can be spun up locally using this command.

## Creating the Next.js App

To create our *Next.js* app simply run:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
From there, follow the instructions in the terminal to select which components to include. I recommend the default options, *TypeScript*, *ESLint*, *app directory*, etc.

After everything finishes downloading we should be able to run our application in development mode using `npm run dev`. But we want to run this app using *Docker* so lets create a *Dockerfile*:
```bash
touch Dockerfile
```
Inspired by [Next.js's dev Dockerfile example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker-compose/next-app/dev.Dockerfile), let's write instructions to copy the source code over to the container's /app directory, install the necessary dependencies and run the application in development mode:
```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine

RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json /app
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```
At this point we have a runnable docker container for our app. Let's get started with our *docker-compose.yaml* and add a profile for this app.
```bash
touch docker-compose.yaml
```
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  next-app:
    container_name: next-app
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      - ./public:/app/public
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```
Now our app can be run by running `docker compose up`.

## Creating the Postgres Database

Let's create a local database using the official [Postgres Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
We can do this by appending the following to our *docker-compose.yaml*:
```yaml
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:16.0
    container_name: postgres-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: example
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 123
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```
Now `docker compose up` additionally spins up a local database which we can connect to by adding the following connection string to a *.env* file in the root of our *Next.js* project:
```bash
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://root:123@localhost:5432/example"
```
We currently have no way of testing our database through our *Next.js* app but we can verify that the database is running by executing `psql example` through *Docker Desktop*:

## Populating the Database
To interact with our database from our *Next.js* app we need an ORM tool. Let's install my favorite database ORM *drizzle-orm*:
```bash
npm install drizzle-orm postgres pg
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```
Now let's set up our first table using *drizzle-orm* by loosely following the [official quick start example](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/quick):

1. Create our first schema:

```bash
touch src/schema/post.ts
```
```typescript
import { serial, text, timestamp, pgTable } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const post = pgTable("post", {
  id: serial("id"),
  text: text("text"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").default(new Date()),
});
```

2. Create our *drizzle* configuration:

```bash
touch drizzle.config.ts
```
```typescript
import type { Config } from "drizzle-kit";

export default {
  schema: "./src/schemas/*.ts",
  out: "./src/migrations",
  driver: "pg",
  dbCredentials: {
    connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL!,
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

3. Create our first migration:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
```
This will create a migration file under *src/migrations*.

4. Apply our migration:

First let's install some necessary dev dependencies:
```bash
npm install -D dotenv tsx
```

Then we can create a migration script:
```bash
touch src/scripts/migrate.ts
```
```typescript
import postgres from "postgres";
import { migrate } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js/migrator";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

(async () => {
  const connectionString = process.env.POSTGRES_URL!;

  const migrationsClient = postgres(connectionString, { max: 1 });
  const db = drizzle(migrationsClient);

  await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: "./src/migrations" });

  await migrationsClient.end();
})();
```
Now we can apply our migration by running the script like so:
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/migration.tsx
```

Finally we can populate our database using *Drizzle Studio*:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit studio
```
![Drizzle Studio](/assets/drizzle-studio.png)

## Connecting to the Database

Now that we have a database up-and-running with data, let's display it in our *Next.js* app!
To do that we must first create a database client:

```bash
touch src/db.ts
```
```typescript
import { drizzle, type PostgresJsDatabase } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";

// Fix for "sorry, too many clients already"
declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var -- only var works here
  var db: PostgresJsDatabase | undefined;
}

let db: PostgresJsDatabase;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  db = drizzle(postgres(process.env.POSTGRES_URL!));
} else {
  if (!global.db) global.db = drizzle(postgres(process.env.POSTGRES_URL!));

  db = global.db;
}

export { db };
```
Using this client, let's display the text from our first post entry by replacing the contents of *src/app/page.tsx* with the following:
```tsx
import { db } from "@/db";
import { post } from "@/schemas/post";
import styles from "./page.module.css";

export default async function Home() {
  const posts = await db.select().from(post);

  return <main className={styles.main}>{posts[0].text}</main>;
}
```
If we run our *Next.js* app locally we should see a black screen with the text "Hello World".
But if we run this using *Docker Compose* we will get an error because our *Next.js* container is unable to connect to our *Postgres* container.
This is because our connection string uses localhost but for docker containers to connect to one another they must use the appropriate *Docker Compose* service name.

Let's fix this by adding the following line to our *.env* file:
```bash
DOCKER_POSTGRES_URL="postgres://root:123@postgres-db:5432/example"
```
And let's tell *Docker Compose* to replace *POSTGRES_URL* with *DOCKER_POSTGRES_URL* by adding the following to our *docker-compose.yaml*'s next-app section:
```yaml
environment:
  POSTGRES_URL: ${DOCKER_POSTGRES_URL}
```
If we run `docker compose up` now, we should see our text displaying correctly.
But if we save any additional changes while the app is running, our app does not update...

## Enabling Docker Compose Watch

To leverage the hot-module reloading capabilities of `docker compose watch` we must define watch actions in our *docker-compose.yaml* to tell *Docker Compose* to sync our code when we save it.
To do this, replace our previously defined volumes with appropriate sync actions so that the final *docker-compose.yaml* file looks like this:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  next-app:
    container_name: next-app
    restart: always
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      POSTGRES_URL: ${DOCKER_POSTGRES_URL}
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: ./src
          target: /app/src
          ignore:
            - node_modules/
        - action: sync
          path: ./public
          target: /app/public
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:16.0
    container_name: postgres-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: example
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 123
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```
Now we can finally run `docker compose watch` to have our 2 containers run and respond to changes!

And as our application grows in complexity we can add additional services to our *Docker Compose* configuration and enjoy the amazing DX benefits of `docker compose watch`.

The source code for this project is available on [github](https://github.com/kalmanodds/docker-compose-watch-example).

## Caveats

`docker compose watch` does not print container output to the console like `docker compose up`.
To remedy this, we must attach to the containers in a separate terminal session or inspect the output via Docker Desktop.

This new feature also lacks many common option paramters, so running `docker compose watch` in detached mode, for example, does not work.
